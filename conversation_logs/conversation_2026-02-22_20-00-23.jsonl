Trigger if the request:\\n- Mentions Claude, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, or the Anthropic SDK / Agent SDK / API\\n- References Anthropic-specific features (Batches API, Files API, prompt caching, extended thinking, etc.)\\n- Involves building a chatbot, AI agent, or LLM-powered app and the existing code already uses Claude/Anthropic, or no AI SDK has been chosen yet\\n- Describes a program whose core logic requires calling an AI model and no non-Claude SDK is already in use\\nDo NOT trigger if the user is already working with a non-Claude AI platform. Check for these signals BEFORE reading this skill\\'s docs:\\n- Filenames in the prompt referencing another provider (e.g. \"openai\", \"gpt\", \"gemini\" in the filename)\\n- The prompt explicitly mentions using OpenAI, GPT, Gemini, or another non-Claude provider\\n- Existing project files import a non-Claude AI SDK (e.g. openai, google.generativeai, or another provider)\\nThis skill only contains Claude/Anthropic documentation and cannot help with other providers.\\nDo NOT trigger for purely conventional programming with no AI — calculators, timers, unit converters, file utilities, todo apps, password generators, URL shorteners, format converters, or similar deterministic-logic tasks.\\nDo NOT trigger for traditional ML/data science tasks that don\\'t call an LLM API — scikit-learn pipelines, PyTorch model training, pandas/numpy data processing, etc.\\n</system-reminder>'}, {'type': 'text', 'text': \"<system-reminder>\\nAs you answer the user's questions, you can use the following context:\\n# currentDate\\nToday's date is 2026-02-22.\\n\\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks.
