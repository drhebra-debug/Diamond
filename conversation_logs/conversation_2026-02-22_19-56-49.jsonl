Can you guide me through the process? I need to specify the display title, upload files, and optionally specify the beta versions.\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nCertainly! To create a new skill for the Anthropic API, you\\'ll need to use the `SkillCreateParams` class. Here\\'s how you can do it:\\n\\n1. **Specify the display title**: If you have a preferred display title for your skill, you can include it in the `SkillCreateParams` as the `display_title` parameter.\\n\\n2. **Upload files**: The skill files must be included in the `SkillCreateParams` as the `files` parameter. All files must be in the same top-level directory and must include a `SKILL.md` file at the root of that directory.\\n\\n3. **Specify beta versions**: If you want to use a specific beta version, you can include it in the `SkillCreateParams` as the `betas` parameter.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you can use the `SkillCreateParams` class to create a new skill:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom anthropic_api import SkillCreateParams\\n\\n# Create a new SkillCreateParams object\\nskill_params = SkillCreateParams(\\n    display_title=\"My New Skill\",\\n    files=[\"path/to/skill/directory\"],\\n    betas=[\"beta_version_1\", \"beta_version_2\"]\\n)\\n\\n# Now, you can use the `client.skills.create` method to create the skill\\nskill = client.skills.create(skill_params)\\n```\\n\\nLet me know if you need more information or assistance with anything else.\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nThe skill creation was successful, but I\\'m not sure how to retrieve and display the skill details.\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo retrieve and display the skill details, you can use the `client.skills.retrieve` method with the skill ID. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Retrieve the skill ID from the created skill object\\nskill_id = skill.id\\n\\n# Retrieve the skill details using the client\\nskill_details = client.skills.retrieve(skill_id)\\n\\n# Display the skill details\\nprint(skill_details)\\n```\\n\\nThis will print the details of the retrieved skill, including the skill ID, creation timestamp, display title (if any), latest version (if any), source, type, and update timestamp.\\n\\nIf you need more information or assistance with anything else, let me know!\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nI need to list all the skills I have created. Can you help me with that?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo list all the skills you have created, you can use the `client.skills.list` method. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Retrieve the list of skills using the client\\nskills = client.skills.list()\\n\\n# Display the list of skills\\nprint(skills)\\n```\\n\\nThis will print a list of all the skills you have created, including the skill ID, creation timestamp, display title (if any), latest version (if any), source, type, and update timestamp.\\n\\nIf you need more information or assistance with anything else, let me know!\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nI need to create a new skill without any beta versions. Can you help me with that?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nCertainly! To create a new skill without any beta versions, you can omit the `betas` parameter from the `SkillCreateParams` object. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a new SkillCreateParams object without any beta versions\\nskill_params = SkillCreateParams(\\n    display_title=\"My New Skill\",\\n    files=[\"path/to/skill/directory\"],\\n    betas=None\\n)\\n\\n# Create a new client with the provided API key\\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)\\n\\n# Create the skill using the client\\nskill = client.skills.create(skill_params)\\n```\\n\\nThis will create a new skill without any beta versions. Let me know if you need any further assistance.\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nI\\\\\\'m having trouble with the skill creation. Can you provide an example of how to upload files and create a skill?\\\\n\\\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nCertainly! Here\\\\\\'s an example of", "model": "diamond"}
