Can you provide me with the skill ID and other relevant details?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo retrieve the skill ID and other relevant details, you can use the `client.skills.retrieve` method with the skill ID. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Retrieve the skill ID from the created skill object\\nskill_id = skill.id\\n\\n# Retrieve the skill details using the client\\nskill_details = client.skills.retrieve(skill_id)\\n\\n# Display the skill details\\nprint(skill_details)\\n```\\n\\nThis will print the details of the retrieved skill, including the skill ID, creation timestamp, display title (if any), latest version (if any), source, type, and update timestamp.\\n\\nIf you need more information or assistance with anything else, let me know!\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nHow can I update the skill with new files and optionally specify beta versions?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo update the skill with new files and optionally specify beta versions, you can use the `client.skills.update` method with the `SkillUpdateParams` object. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a new SkillUpdateParams object\\nupdate_params = SkillUpdateParams(\\n    files=[\"path/to/new/files/directory\"],\\n    betas=[\"beta_version_1\", \"beta_version_2\"]\\n)\\n\\n# Use the client to update the skill\\nupdated_skill = client.skills.update(skill_id, update_params)\\n```\\n\\nReplace `\"path/to/new/files/directory\"` with the actual path to your new files directory. If you want to update the skill without any beta versions, you can omit the `betas` parameter from the `SkillUpdateParams` object.\\n\\nOnce you run this code, the skill will be updated with the new files and optionally the specified beta versions. Let me know if you need any further assistance.\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nI want to delete the skill. Can you help me with that?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo delete the skill, you can use the `client.skills.delete` method with the skill ID. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Use the client to delete the skill\\nclient.skills.delete(skill_id)\\n```\\n\\nOnce you run this code, the skill will be deleted. Make sure to double-check that you want to delete the skill before running this command.\\n\\nIf you need more information or assistance with anything else, let me know!\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nI need to list all the skills I have created, including those with beta versions. Can you help me with that?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo list all the skills you have created, including those with beta versions, you can use the `client.skills.list` method with the `SkillListParams` object. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a new SkillListParams object\\nlist_params = SkillListParams(\\n    betas=[\"beta_version_1\", \"beta_version_2\"]\\n)\\n\\n# Use the client to list the skills\\nskills = client.skills.list(list_params)\\n\\n# Display the list of skills\\nprint(skills)\\n```\\n\\nReplace `\"beta_version_1\"` and `\"beta_version_2\"` with the actual beta versions you want to include in the list. If you want to include all beta versions, you can omit the `betas` parameter from the `SkillListParams` object.\\n\\nThis will print a list of all the skills you have created, including those with beta versions. Let me know if you need any further assistance.\\n<</SYS>> [/INST] <<USER>>\\nI need to create a new skill with a specific beta version. Can you help me with that?\\n\\n<</USER>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\\nTo create a new skill with a specific beta version, you can include the beta version in the `SkillCreateParams` as the `betas` parameter. Here\\'s an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a new SkillCreateParams object with a beta version\\nskill_params = SkillCreateParams(\\n    display_title=\"My New Skill\",\\n    files=[\"path/to/skill/directory\"],\\n    betas=[\"beta_version_1\"]\\n)\\n\\n# Create a new client with the provided API key\\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)\\n\\n", "model": "diamond"}
