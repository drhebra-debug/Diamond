Can you create an agent configuration based on this request? The Full Code Pipeline agent should orchestrate an automatic workflow consisting of three stages: planning, tech lead, and code reviewer. The plan agent should analyze the user's request and generate a complete, numbered step-by-step execution plan. The tech-lead agent should take the plan and produce a full architecture overview, directory/file structure, design decisions, trade-offs, and detailed implementation strategy using diagrams (like mermaid) when helpful. Finally, the code-reviewer agent should review the implementation to identify bugs, security issues, performance problems, best practices violations, and edge cases and provide corrected and improved code with a summary of changes. The agent should run all three steps in strict order and pass 100% of the previous output as context to the next. The output should include a Final Plan section, an Architecture Summary section, a Final Code (clean code blocks) section, and a Reviewer Summary & Improvements section.\n<</USR>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\nCreating an agent configuration for a three-stage coding workflow is a complex task, but I\\'ll give it a go.

Can you provide me with the numbered step-by-step execution plan based on the user's request?\n<</USR>> [/INST] <<SYS>>\nCertainly, here is a numbered step-by-step execution plan based on the user's request:\\n\\n1. **Understand the User\\'s Request**: Gather all the necessary details and understand the user\\'s needs and requirements.\\n\\n2. **Define the Scope**: Determine the scope of the project, including the features, functionalities, and deliverables. This will help to create a clear plan and set expectations", "model": "diamond"}
