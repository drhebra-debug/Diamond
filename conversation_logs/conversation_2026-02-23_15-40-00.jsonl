Trigger if the request:\\n- Mentions Claude, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, or the Anthropic SDK / Agent SDK / API\\n- References Anthropic-specific features (Batches API, Files API, prompt caching, extended thinking, etc.)\\n- Involves building a chatbot, AI agent, or LLM-powered app and the existing code already uses Claude/Anthropic, or no AI SDK has been chosen yet\\n- Describes a program whose core logic requires calling an AI model and no non-Claude SDK is already in use\\nDo NOT trigger if the user is already working with a non-Claude AI platform. Check for these signals BEFORE reading this skill\\'s docs:\\n- Filenames in the prompt referencing another provider (e.g. \"openai\", \"gpt\", \"gemini\" in the filename)\\n- The prompt explicitly mentions using OpenAI, GPT, Gemini, or another non-Claude provider\\n- Existing project files import a non-Claude AI SDK (e.g. openai, google.generativeai, or another provider)\\nThis skill only contains Claude/Anthropic documentation and cannot help with other providers.\\nDo NOT trigger for purely conventional programming with no AI — calculators, timers, unit converters, file utilities, todo apps, password generators, URL shorteners, format converters, or similar deterministic-logic tasks.\\nDo NOT trigger for traditional ML/data science tasks that don\\'t call an LLM API — scikit-learn pipelines, PyTorch model training, pandas/numpy data processing, etc.\\n</system-reminder>'}, {'type': 'text', 'text': \"<system-reminder>\\nAs you answer the user's questions, you can use the following context:\\n# currentDate\\nToday's date is 2026-02-23.\\n\\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks.

Can you help me set up a CLAUDE.md file to make it easier for me to develop and manage the codebase?\n[/USER] <<INST>>\nI understand that you're working on a chatbot codebase and you need help setting up a CLAUDE.md file. Based on the system-reminder provided, I can help you create a CLAUDE.md file with common development tasks, architecture, and structure. However, since I don't have access to the actual codebase, I'll provide a generic CLAUDE.md template to get you started. You can modify it based on your specific needs.\n\nHere is a generic CLAUDE.md template:\n\n```\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Common Development Tasks\n\n- **Build**: Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.\n- **Lint**: Run `npm run lint` to check for code style errors.\n- **Test**: Run `npm test` to execute all unit tests.\n- **Run**: Run `npm start` to start the chatbot locally.\n- **Commit**: Run `npm run commit` to commit changes to the repository.\n\n## Code Architecture and Structure\n\nThe codebase is organized into the following directories:\n\n- `src/`: Contains the main application code.\n- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the application.\n- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the application.\n- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the application.\n\n## Support and Documentation\n\nFor more information on how to use the chatbot, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) file in the repository.\n\n## Tips for Development\n\n- Always write unit tests for new utilities.\n- Follow the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) code style guide.\n- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.\n- Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.\n- Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.\n\n## Commands\n\nTo build the chatbot, run:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nTo lint the code, run:\n\n```\nnpm run lint\n```\n\nTo run the unit tests, run:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nTo start the chatbot locally, run:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nTo commit changes to the repository, run:\n\n```\nnpm run commit\n```\n\nRemember to modify this template based on your specific codebase and development practices. If you need any further assistance or have any specific questions, feel free to ask!\n[/INST]", "model": "diamond"}
